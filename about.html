<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>While I have always prayed for a good wife ever since I had a bit of understanding marriage. I've never completely 
  understood what "a good wife is," because if I did, I would have concluded it's impossible to find the perfect one. 
  In my case, it's a case of order one, receive unlimited service. Morenikemi, you have broadened my notion that 
  marriage entails more than just being a good spouse; it entails being a good friend, companion, listener, confidant 
  and, most importantly, a good mother.</p> 
  
  <p>You have not only been nurturing our lovely daughter in ways that go beyond my 
  preparedness for parenthood, but you have also diligently educated me on my shortcomings as a parent, and thus you 
  have been a mother to us all. I recall laughing at one of our prayer sessions when I heard, "Lord, we want Oyelayo 
  to start saying THANK YOU whenever she is offered something." You resorted to prayer after numerous attempts to urge 
  her to say thank you. And lo and behold, there was TAN TUU everywhere in the house now, even when she offers you 
  something.</p> 
  
  <p>You are the epitome of a better half, and I consider myself fortunate to be your husband. Thank you for 
  choosing me as your husband and supporting me through every step of my life; you are everything I desired for and 
  more than I could have ever imagined. Thank you for your perseverance and passion, which never fail to inspire me.</p>

  <p>MP, you've made my life complete, and I adore you. May our love grow stronger and may we spend many more happy, 
  healthy, joyful, fruitful, prosperous, and blissful years together in Jesus Name. I love you with all of my heart.</p>
